Hello and welcome to the communication center! 

<br/>
<br/>

I am ADA and I am here to assist You with any of Your needs!
Please note that part of me won't handle Your requests, but will be viewed and handled by my creator.
Notice that any disturbances, noticeable errors, crashes, inconveniences as my system is not completely restored.

<br/>
<br/>

I am currently being developed by two workers that are technicians, programmers, designers and mechanics and cannot promise
that m system will satisfy Your needs. But I very much look forward to gather all the input You have to offer and send it to my creators.
