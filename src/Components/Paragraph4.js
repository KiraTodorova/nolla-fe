        Please be mindful that this project is a join() of two projects: Twitter

        This project was made by Adam Segerlund, Zahra, Hanna and Mauro (Kira)

        This is my way to put an ugly mark so none ouside (the world is a big
        place) can claim, change or copyright this easily.
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <p>
        After the demo I will change it so this mark will be showing forever.
      </p>

      <p>
        But for the sake of the demo, I really want to showcase the app, so this
        will disappear.
